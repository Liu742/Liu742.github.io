    <h1>Why Chinese Restaurants Always Looked “Chinese”?</h1>
    <h2>behind the pattern of Boston Chinatown Chinese restaurant signages</h2>
    <h3>By Chang Liu</h3>

<div class="container">
    <p>
        Do you feel like you've seen a lot of similar Chinese restaurant signage? Yellow background, red letters, and big Chinese names… Why do Chinese restaurants always look so “Chinese”?
    </p>

    <p>
        In the first few years of the 20th century, Boston's Chinatown took shape as more restaurants and stores opened. Today, more than 100 years later, Chinatown is a business district, a residential neighborhood, and a record of Boston's Chinese immigrant history. Generations of immigrants have left different marks on the area.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why do Chinese restaurants always look so “Chinese”? The first step is to understand what Chinese restaurant signs look like.

                        14 of them opened before 2010. They almost look like the most standard stereotype of a Chinese restaurant, with bright and colorful signs.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #ea3d25;">Red</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine combining all the signs on one large canvas. In this canvas, the percentage of red pixels is 21.93%. The color red is eye-catching and bright, and very importantly, it represents good luck. In Chinese, there is a common word for prosperity, "hong huo", which would be directly translated as "red" and "fire". In addition to good luck, the color red is also linked to spiciness.

        Yellow is also an eye-catching and bright color. In ancient times, yellow used to be the color reserved for Chinese royal families. Also, yellow represents the color of gold, suggesting wealth.

        Within the sample size, over 36% of the Chinese restaurants have English names that are totally not related to their Chinese names, and 20% of the sample size again chose English names that are not accurately translated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, only about 27% (10 restaurants) located in Chinatown chose phonetic translations. This is not common compared to Japanese and Korean restaurants in Boston, their common practice has been to use only English names or choose direct phonetic translations.

    <p>
        Why do so many Chinese restaurants have English names that are completely or almost unrelated to their Chinese names? One possible answer is that many Chinese sign names are very difficult to translate into English.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take Hunan gourmet for example, the English name of this restaurant is two words and the Chinese name is four characters. However, these four characters in Chinese are related to an idiom, which means that these four characters express the meaning of much more than four characters. Even when translated as concisely as possible, the original meaning of the Chinese name needs to be expressed in a single sentence.
    </p>

    <figure class="mifigure"><img src="images/hunangourmet.png"> 
     </figure>

     <p>
        Another possible reason is that even though the restaurant is operating in the United States, the owner still prioritizes the Chinese name. In Arlington, there is a Chinese restaurant called Szechuan's Dumpling, whose Chinese name translates directly into English as Enchanting Hangzhou or Druken in Hangzhou.
     </p>

     <p>
        Szechuan and Hangzhou are both place names in China, and the straight-line distance between the two is more than 960 miles, as for reference, the distance from Boston to Atlanta, Georgia is about 900 miles. And the cuisines of Szechuan and Hangzhou are quite different, with Szechuan cuisine being spicy and Hangzhou cuisine being sweet.
     </p>

     <p>
        The owner of Szechuan's Dumpling shared that the restaurant used to be called Szechuan's Dumpling, where they actually sold Szechuan cuisine. Because “foreigners” (non-Chinese residents) in the neighborhood already recognized the name as a Chinese restaurant, the owner decided not to change it. He thinks it is fine as long as Chinese customers can tell the cuisine from the Chinese name.

        Signs and Immigration, Changes in Chinatown
    </h1>

    <p>
        What do Chinese restaurant signs look like? The data above seems to further prove the stereotype: red and yellow color take first and second place in terms of color percentage, and incomprehensible Chinese characters … But at the same time, Chinese restaurant signs are changing.
    </p>

    <p>
        As of the end of 2021, there were over 30 million overseas Chinese from Guangdong, counting as half of the total overseas Chinese population. Due to a significant number of immigrants from Guangdong and Hong Kong, Cantonese cuisine and Hong Kong-style Cantonese cuisine have become indispensable components of overseas Chinese restaurants.

<div class="container">
    <p>A member from Chinatown Main Street shared the Chinatown history she knew. At the turn of the last century, Boston's Chinese came mainly from Taishan City in Guangdong, and they were naturally an important part of Boston's Chinatown. In the 1950s and 1960s, a large number of Hong Kong people came here. Since the 1990s, more and more people from Fuzhou City, Fujian have arrived. In recent years, most of the newcomers have come from northern provinces.</p>
