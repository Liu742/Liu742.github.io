        From arrests for blocking traffic to disruptions in meetings and climbing substation fences, whenever the "Extinction Rebellion" Boston chapter makes headlines, it is almost always portrayed with a rebellious and unruly image.</p>
    <p>
        However, on the flip side of this perceived 'extreme' and 'aggressive' stance, the organization also participates in some 'unexpected,' peaceful, and community-centered activities.
    </p>

    <p>
        On November 24, 2023, Black Friday, Extinction Rebellion organized a "Buy Nothing Day Party" at Calvary United Methodist Church in Arlington—a free goods exchange and donation event. The organizers emphasized, "Instead of celebrating gross consumerism, celebrate sustainability and community!"

In addition to members of Extinction Rebellion, many residents from Arlington and the surrounding area also took part in the event. (Chang Liu)</figcaption>

    <p>Fan Lu, an Arlington resident, said that she had only read about the Extinction Rebellion on the news before, and she thought it was a somewhat radical organization. However, she noted that today's event was a positive, friendly, and harmless event, so she was willing to come. The organizer emphasized during the speech that many participants are not necessarily members of Extinction Rebellion, stating, "Here in our community, even some that haven't set out necessarily to be climate activists, have a vision of what is a more profound life than the commercialism of the world around us."</p>

He stated, "We find ourselves on the day when most of commercial society tells us to buy more and more. And instead, we're here buying nothing." The event encouraged participants to bring surplus items from their homes and gift them to those in need. (Chang Liu)</figcaption>

        In addition to non-violent direct action, Extinction Rebellion attracts attention for its colorful and artistic advocacy.
        They hold an art studio almost every week at the Puppet Free Library in Back Bay. Promotional items needed for the event are handmade by the members. Anna Pancoast, an active member of the Art Working Group, organized the first art studio in Arlington on October 28th.

        On November 25th, about a dozen members met again at the Mystic Open Studio in Arlington. This is a new location just starting out, and considering the storage of tools and materials, Anna decided to start with making the most basic flags first.

        These flags are prepared for many future events, such as several events recently organized in response to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28). "COP28 will inevitably be one of the year's biggest disappointments", Extinction Rebellion is taking a stark opposition to the COP28 and actively invites interested parties to get involved. Communications Director Jamie McGonagill took the initiative to mention a potential concern, "We do not announce civil disobedience actions on our website, so anything you see there is open attendance to anyone."

    <p>Regarding the reputation of being "radical" and "troublesome," Jamie McGonagill stated, "In our daily lives, we are a group of gentle people.  Like you see at parties and art studios. Many of my close friends are in Extinction Rebellion, and our members include teachers, researchers, artists... We are just too afraid, too afraid that no one will pay attention to climate change, no one will value the future."</p>
