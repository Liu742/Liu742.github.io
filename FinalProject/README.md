## Description

<p>
This project is dedicated to providing data related to female education worldwide, examining current statistics, and exploring the various factors that influence these numbers. Empowering girls through education is crucial for promoting gender equality, reducing poverty, and fostering sustainable development. By presenting this data, the goal is to raise awareness and inspire action to make a lasting impact on the lives of girls and women everywhere.
<br>
The questions I want to address are: What is the current situation of female education globally? And which factors impact women's access to education?
<br>
I have used data from the World Bank, which includes datasets on primary school enrollment rates, secondary school enrollment rates, expected years of school, and mean age at first marriage. Additionally, I have incorporated data from the World Bank report titled “COUNT ME IN! World Bank Education: Improving Education Outcomes for Girls and Young Women.”
